# Character-Level LSTM

In this project, I will implement an RNN of my own. The RNN is a character-level text prediction with an LSTM!

# Steps
- Load in text data
- Pre-process that data, encoding characters as integers and creating one-hot input vectors
- Define an RNN that predicts the next character when given an input sequence
- Train the RNN and use it to generate new text
